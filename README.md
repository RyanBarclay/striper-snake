# Striper-snake

This is a Snake entry for the [BattleSnake](http://battlesnake.io) programming competition in Victoria BC, written in Python.

Forked from the [Python starter snake](https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-python) provided by [sendwithus](https://www.sendwithus.com).

This AI client uses the [bottle web framework](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) to serve requests and the [gunicorn web server](http://gunicorn.org/) for running bottle on [Heroku](https://heroku.com). Dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

###### This is a simple snake that might actualy stand a chance versus:

1) Snakes coded by groups of people

2) Snakes coded by people who copy and paste alpha go (advanced game neural network AI)  looking at you [CBinners](https://github.com/cbinners)

3) Snakes coded by people that are way better at coding then me

## State of AI

  * 2019/02/13:
    * Basic AI complete
      * Snake finds closest food
      * Finds moves that won't make it die
      * Executes move that will align head vertically with food, else executes first move that is deemed ***safe***
    * App runs on [Heroku](http://heroku.com)
    * Clears all status checks on [play.battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.io)

## Running the Snake Locally

1) [Fork this repo](https://github.com/RyanBarclay/striper-snake/fork).

2) Clone repo to your development environment:
```
git clone git@github.com:username/battlesnake-python.git
```

3) Install dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4) Run local server:
```
python app/main.py
```

5) Test client in your browser: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Deploying to Heroku

1) Create a new Heroku app:
```
heroku create [APP_NAME]
```

2) Deploy code to Heroku servers:
```
git push heroku master
```

3) Open Heroku app in browser:
```
heroku open
```
or visit [http://APP_NAME.herokuapp.com](http://APP_NAME.herokuapp.com).

4) View server logs with the `heroku logs` command:
```
heroku logs --tail
```
